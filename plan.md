That's a great starting point for your first version. To build a simple web application that allows users to upload a chatlog and view analysis charts for a specific character, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Define the Functionality
- **User Input**: An interface for users to upload a chatlog file (.txt format) and enter a character name.
- **Data Processing**: Your Python script (like the one you developed) to process the uploaded file and generate the required data for the character.
- **Data Visualization**: Display charts based on the processed data.

### 2. Choose Your Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Since you are familiar with Python, use Flask or Django for the backend. These frameworks can handle file uploads and process the data.
- **Frontend**: For the frontend, you can start with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you want to use a framework, React.js or Vue.js are good options.
- **Data Visualization**: You can use JavaScript libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for rendering charts in the browser.

### 3. Setting Up the Backend
- **File Upload**: Implement a REST API endpoint in Flask or Django to handle file uploads.
- **Data Analysis**: Integrate your Python script for analyzing the uploaded chatlog and extracting data for the specified character.
- **API Response**: The backend should send the processed data back to the frontend in a format that can be easily used to display charts (e.g., JSON).

### 4. Creating the Frontend
- **User Interface**: Create a simple form for file upload and character name input.
- **API Integration**: Use JavaScript to make requests to your backend API, send the file and character name, and receive the processed data.
- **Chart Display**: Utilize a chart library to display the data received from the backend.

### 5. Testing
- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that the file upload, data processing, and chart display functionalities are working as expected.

### 6. Running the App Locally
- Initially, run and test the app on your local machine.

### 7. Future Considerations
- As you develop, consider adding error handling, user feedback (e.g., loading indicators), and possibly a database if you plan to store user inputs or analysis results.

### 8. Learning Resources
- There are many tutorials available online for Flask/Django and React/Vue which can guide you through setting up a project, handling file uploads, making API calls, and displaying data.

### Conclusion
Starting with a focused scope like this is a great approach. It allows you to build a foundation that you can later expand upon. Remember, the key is to start simple and gradually add more features as you become more comfortable with the technologies.
